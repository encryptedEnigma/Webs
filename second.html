  <h3><a name="webd"></a>Web Developement</h3>
  <p>Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web
of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications (or
refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development,
client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and
network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web
professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design
aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. Most
recently Web development has come to mean the creation of content
management systems or CMS. These CMS can be made from scratch,
proprietary or open source. In broad terms the CMS acts as middleware between

For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of
hundreds of people (web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile
methodologies while developing websites. Smaller organizations may only require
a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related
job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician.
 Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than
the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of web developer
specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer,
and full-stack developer. Front-end developers deal with the layout and
visuals of a website, while back-end developers deal with the functionality
of a website. Back-end developers will program in the functions of a website
that will collect data.</p>
  <h3><a name="linux"></a>Linux Fundamentals </h3>
  <p>Linux powers 94% of the world’s supercomputers, most of the servers
    powering the Internet, the majority of financial trades worldwide and a
    billion Android devices. In short, Linux is everywhere. This instructor-led
    course will give you a good working knowledge of Linux, from both a
    graphical and command line perspective, allowing you to easily navigate
    through any of the major Linux distributions.</p>
  <h3><a name="programming"></a>Programming fundamnetals</h3>
  <p>Programming is an increasingly important skill, whether you aspire to a
    career in software development, or in other fields. This course is the first
     in the specialization Introduction to Programming in C, but its lessons
     extend to any language you might want to learn. This is because programming
      is fundamentally about figuring out how to solve a class of problems and
      writing the algorithm, a clear set of steps to solve any problem in its
      class. This course will introduce you to a powerful problem-solving
      process—the Seven Steps—which you can use to solve any programming
      problem. In this course, you will learn how to develop an algorithm, then
      progress to reading code and understanding how programming concepts relate
      to algorithms.</p>
  <h3><a name="net"></a>Computer Networking</h3>
  <p>Definition - What does Computer Networking mean?
 the communication process among various computing devices or computer systems
 that are linked, or networked, together to exchange information and share
 resources.

Computer networking depends on the theoretical application and practical
implementation of fields like computer engineering, computer sciences,
information technology and telecommunication.

Techopedia explains Computer Networking
A router, network card and protocols are the essential pillars upon which
any network is built. Computer networks are the backbone of modern-day
communication. Even public switched telephone networks are controlled by
computer systems; most telephonic services are also working with IP.

The increasing scope of communication has led to much advancement in the
networking field and in its relative industries like hardware, software
manufacturing and integration. As a result, most households have access
to one or more networks. There are three broad network types:

Local Area Network (LAN): Used to serve a small number of people located in a
small geographical space. Peer-to-peer or client server networking methods can
be employed.
Wide Area Network (WAN): Formed to connect a computer with its peripheral
resources across a large geographical area.
Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)/Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN): Formed
without the use of wires or physical media to connect hosts with the server.
The data is transferred over radio transceivers.</p>
  <h3><a name="math"></a>Engineering Mathematics</h3>
  <p>Engineering mathematics is a branch of applied mathematics concerning
    mathematical methods and techniques that are typically used in engineering
    and industry. Along with fields like engineering physics and engineering
    geology, both of which may belong in the wider category engineering science,
    engineering mathematics is an interdisciplinary subject motivated by
    engineers' needs both for practical, theoretical and other considerations
    outwith their specialization, and to deal with constraints to be effective
    in their work.

Description
Historically, engineering mathematics consisted mostly of applied analysis,
most notably: differential equations; real and complex analysis (including
vector and tensor analysis); approximation theory (broadly construed, to include
 asymptotic, variational, and perturbative methods, representations, numerical
 analysis); Fourier analysis; potential theory; as well as linear algebra and
 applied probability, outside of analysis. These areas of mathematics were
 intimately tied to the development of Newtonian physics, and the mathematical
 physics of that period. This history also left a legacy: until the early 20th
 century subjects such as classical mechanics were often taught in applied
 mathematics departments at American universities, and fluid mechanics may
 still be taught in (applied) mathematics as well as engineering departments.[1]

The success of modern numerical computer methods and software has led to the
emergence of computational mathematics, computational science, and computational
Type 4: Self-awareness. In this category, AI systems have a sense of self, have
consciousness. Machines with self-awareness understand their current state and
can use the information to infer what others are feeling. This type of AI does
not yet exist./p>
 engineering (the last two are sometimes lumped together and abbreviated as
 CS&E), which occasionally use high-performance computing for the simulation
 of phenomena and the solution of problems in the sciences and engineering.
 These are often considered interdisciplinary fields, but are also of interest
 to engineering mathematics.[2]

Specialized branches include engineering optimization and engineering statistics.

Engineering mathematics in tertiary education typically consists of mathematical
 methods and models courses.</p>
  <h3><a name="ai"></a>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
  <p>AI (artificial intelligence) is the simulation of human intelligence
    processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include
    learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the
    information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite
    conclusions) and self-correction. Particular applications of AI include
    expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision<. AI was coined by
    John McCarthy, an American computer scientist, in 1956 at The Dartmouth
    Conference where the discipline was born. Today, it is an umbrella term
    that encompasses everything from robotic process automation to actual
    robotics. It has gained prominence recently due, in part, to big data,
    or the increase in speed, size and variety of data businesses are now
    collecting. AI can perform tasks such as identifying patterns in the data
    more efficiently than humans, enabling businesses to gain more insight out
    of their data.

Types of artificial intelligence
AI can be categorized in any number of ways, but here are two examples.

The first classifies AI systems as either weak AI or strong AI. Weak AI, also
known as narrow AI, is an AI system that is designed and trained for a
particular task. Virtual personal assistants, such as Apple's Siri, are
a form of weak AI.

Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, is an AI system
with generalized human cognitive abilities so that when presented with an
unfamiliar task, it has enough intelligence to find a solution. The Turing
Test, developed by mathematician Alan Turing in 1950, is a method used to
determine if a computer can actually think like a human, although the method
is controversial.

The second example is from Arend Hintze, an assistant professor of integrative
biology and computer science and engineering at Michigan State University.
He categorizes AI into four types, from the kind of AI systems that exist
today to sentient systems, which do not yet exist. His categories are as follows:

Type 1: Reactive machines. An example is Deep Blue, the IBM chess program that
beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can identify pieces on the chess
board and make predictions, but it has no memory and cannot use past
experiences to inform future ones. It analyzes possible moves -- its own and
its opponent -- and chooses the most strategic move. Deep Blue and Google's
AlphaGO were designed for narrow purposes and cannot easily be applied to
another situation.
Computer networking is an engineering discipline that aims to study and analyze
Type 2: Limited memory. These AI systems can use past experiences to inform
 future decisions. Some of the decision-making functions in autonomous vehicles
  have been designed this way. Observations used to inform actions happening in
  the not-so-distant future, such as a car that has changed lanes. These
  observations are not stored permanently.
Type 3: Theory of mind. This is a psychology term. It refers to the
understanding that others have their own beliefs, desires and intentions that
impact the decisions they make. This kind of AI does not yet exist.
